# pomodoroTimer

This project is just a pomodoro timer, with the basic functionality -- no bells and whistles. I've putted the standard intervals ( pomodori = 25min , short rest = 5min and long rest = 15min).

The only different module that I've used is the use-sound, and it was useful to generate the beep sound to indicate the finish of a pomodori, or a rest. When a pomodori or rest has ended, the next period starts imediately.
